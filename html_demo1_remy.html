  <p>Remy came to the Creightons from American Brittany Rescue although he is a <i>French</i> Brittany.  He has also made the moves from Kalispell to Bozeman, Bethany Beach, Raleigh, Cary, and Orlando.  He loves to run and pulls Andy in the wheelchair like a chariot along side walks and paved trails hunting for squirrels and whatnot.</p>
